# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

The password generator is created to give the user
a random password with their choice of characters 
(lower case, upper case, numbers, special characters) and
their choice of the length of the password, as long as it
is between 8 and 128 characters.

I used the prompt and confirm methods so that the user
could input the amount of characters and which characters
they want in their password.

I created the function generatePassword() with if statements,
which put the string variables of all the characters into an empty
array. I used a for loop to loop through the password with the
Math.random method to generate a random password.

### New code that I learned and used for the first time

* prompt method
* confirm method
